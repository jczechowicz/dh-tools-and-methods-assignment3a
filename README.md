# Making Sense Out of Pokédex – A Short Research on Pokémon Statistics

### ****Introduction****

**What is Pokémon and Pokédex?**

- *Pokémon*, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a popular Japanese media franchise that began as a series of video games in year 1996 and has since expanded into various forms of media such as animated series, movies, trading cards, etc. The franchise takes place in the universal world where trainers embark on journeys to catch and train Pokémon creatures, engaging in battles and completing challenges in a fictional world.
- *The Pokédex*, an integral part of the Pokémon universe, is a comprehensive electronic device that records information about Pokémon species. It serves as an encyclopedia for trainers, providing details about a Pokémon's type, abilities, and statistics, including HP (HealthPoints), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Speed Defence, Speed, and overall Total stats.

**Project Overview**

This repository contains a short research project centered around Pokémon statistics. Using Python and pandas for data analysis, the aim is to uncover interesting insights from Pokémon datasets. While primarily designed as a practical exercise for university training, the project also serves as an opportunity to explore and present information in a visually engaging manner.

### Variables

| HEADER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| # | ID for each pokemon |
| Name | Name of each pokemon |
| Type | Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks |
| Weakness | Some pokemon are dual type and have a second weakness |
| Total | sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is |
| HP | health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting |
| Attack | the base modifier for normal attacks |
| Defense | the base damage resistance against normal attacks |
| Sp. Atk | special attack, the base modifier for special attacks |
| Sp. Def | the base damage resistance against special attacks |
| Speed | determines which pokemon attacks first each round |

### ****Acknowledgements****

The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle website. Its original author is [Alberto Barradas](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon/). The data for this csv file has been acquired from several different sites, including: 

- [pokemon.com](http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/)
- [pokemondb](http://pokemondb.net/pokedex)
- [bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_National_Pok%C3%A9dex_number)

***Important***: This dataset is about the pokemon games (*NOT* pokemon cards or Pokemon Go).

### Goals

This research project aims to answer specific questions through visualizations generated by code. The goals can be outlined in several steps:

1. **General Patterns:** The initial focus is on presenting general patterns by visualizing each column and its parameters, offering an overall understanding of the Pokémon dataset.
2. **Top 3 Highest Noted Pokémon:** Identifying and showcasing the top 3 Pokémon in each category, considering attributes such as HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed.
3. **Highest "Total" Pokémon by Type and Weakness:** The project extends its analysis to determine the Pokémon with the highest "total" stats for every "type" and "weakness" category. This step results in two distinct plots:
    - **Strongest Pokémon by Type:** Illustrating the Pokémon deemed the "strongest" within each type category.
    - **Pokémon with Highest "Total" by Type and Weakness:** Displaying the Pokémon with the highest "total" stats for each type, alongside their corresponding weaknesses.
